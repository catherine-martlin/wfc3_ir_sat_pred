This directory contains a prototpye of a tools that may ultimately be used for predicting whether an
exposure is a bad actor

At present there is one tool that uses the 2 Mass catalog for this

The routine actor.py can be run from the command line

actor.py name  RA  Dec  filter exposure

A more complete desciption can be obtained by excuting actor.py without any of the follow-on inputs.

A couple of examples are in the file Examples

Note that this routine should run on any standard STScI machine.  bad_actor.py must be made executable, 
but nothing else should be required.

****

Add `persist_2mass.py` scripts for generating scaled 2MASS cutouts from information extracted from
an APT file.  The `parse_apt.py` file contains tools for extracting target + exposure information
useful to both scripts.

**** 
Added my version of a routine to read the apt files, read_apt.py.  I'm not sure which is better
