# wfc3_ir_sat_pred
This is the Python 3 version created by Knox that wasn't previously put into production due to software issues. My updates will allow usage of Montage 6 and hopefully remove extra software dependencies. 

Currently can be run from the command line on a list of proposal IDs with `eval_all.py` or on a single proposal with `eval_one.py`.
